# secret-server

## [How to run]

run ```docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d``` in the root directory. This will create the backend, frontend, and mongodb.

- Frontend access: localhost:3000
- Backend access: localhost:4040

It might take a while when everything is built for the first time :)
